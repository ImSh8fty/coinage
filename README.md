# Coinage
 
This is my first ever Godot Project... or even Game Development Project!

So, what have I learned?

I taught myself how to create working spikes, and when the main character dies, the character repsawns at its origin point

I laos taught myself hwo to make a moving saw, which acts like the a spike but goes back and forth. I had some issues with the going back and forth part 
but I figured out that when the saw hits something (in my case, a grass block) it stops the ability to move back and forth. So what I did was just move the saw
and adjust its movement so it goes where it needs to go without hitting a grassblock. 

I also taught myself how to create collectable coins and how to make the character double jump!

This game is just a simple 2D platformer where you collect coins without getting hit by anything dangerous.
